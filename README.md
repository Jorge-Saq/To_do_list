## To Do List

# Description
This is a Todo List. Users are able to open/create a new file with the proper format to make this code run.
(Format) Tilte of task, Description of task, yes/no on completion of task
Users can then add, remove, change completion, or print the list/insturctions

This was a beginner project for my Computer Science Class. However, now I am expanding it to make it run much cleaner and smoother.
I also want to potentially be able to create a better design instead of the current terminal view.
